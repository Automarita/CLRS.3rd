2-4 Inversion
=============

Let A[1..n] be an array of n distinct numbers. If i<j and A[i] > A[j], then the pair(i,j) is called an inversion of A.

Give an algorithm that determines the number of inversions in any permutation on n elements in theta(n lg n) worst-case time. (Hint: Modify merge sort)

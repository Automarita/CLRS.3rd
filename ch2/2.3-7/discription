*********************************
Given a set S of n integers and another integer x, determines whether or not there exist two elements in S whose sum is exactly x.

Each input file contains one test case.  Each case begins with a line containing an integer N(less than 1M) which indicates the size of of set S. And then N integers follow in next line.  The last line is the integer x.

For each test case.  If you find there are two elements whose sum is x, print it in a line, note it may not only single combination, print them in increase order of the first element. Otherwise, print "NO WAY" in a line.

Sample input:
3
1 3 4
4
Sample output:
4=1+3

Sorting Algorithms Box
=========================

Discription
-----------
It's a simple "Sorting Algorithms Box" for self-learning.
"rand_num_gen" to generate a line of random number which may be the input of any sorting process.
"mysort" is the main program to switch different algorithm to test, note this program only read the input from file (including pipe), if you try to make a manual input, you will never get a termination of that.

Usage
-----
Execute "make" in this directory, and you will get a binary called "mysort".  You should prepare an input file to test or you just compile the "rand_num_gen" to generate one.  And using redirection or pipe to the "mysort", the default output is the terminal.

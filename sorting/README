It's a simple "Sorting Algorithm Box" for self-learning.
"rand_num_gen" to generate a line of random number which may be the input of any sorting process.
"mysort" is the main program to switch different algorithm to test, note this program only read the input from file (including pipe), if you try to make a manual input, you will never get a termination of that.
